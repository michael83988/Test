This is my first github projectss, just for testing.

The modification of this file was conducted in the other branch, which is not what I want. So I modified the file again to see the function of version control of GitHub.

How to pull requests? Just need to modify the original file? It seems that after modifing the file, click the "Propose changes" at the bottom of the page with "Create a new branch for this commit" chosed.
